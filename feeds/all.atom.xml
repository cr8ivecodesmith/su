&lt;p&gt;I'm a curious guy. I look a the world with an eye of wonder. When I'm interested in something -- may
it be a game, a skill, a piece of technology, a practice, etc. -- I tend to learn as much as I can
about it. Use or learn it to the way it should be or bring it to its full potential. Sometimes I
even go a step further and use or apply it in unexpected ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This space is dedicated to those endeavors that I may always remember them.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="none"></category></entry><entry><title>4 weeks to fitness experiment</title><link href="http://su.mattlebrun.com/4-weeks-to-fitness-experiment.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-01-02T17:48:00+08:00</updated><author><name>matt lebrun</name></author><id>tag:su.mattlebrun.com,2014-01-02:4-weeks-to-fitness-experiment.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A healthy programmer, is an effective programmer.&lt;br /&gt;
- me (when deciding to write this post)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my key goals for this year is to get in to the habit of keeping myself 
healthy. I believe its in our best interest as software engineers to have a 
balanced lifestlye to ensure that we are always working to the best of our 
abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since April of last year I've started feeling my way towards adding regular 
exercises as part of my weekly activities. I make sure that I do something to 
get my blood pumping at least once a week. While I've not been emperically 
tracking the effects of these efforts, It just feels good to get some 
adrenaline rush every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side note, my body fat percentage did became normal which was a first!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I decided to take things up a notch for this month in the efforts of 
making this habit stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be following a 
&lt;a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/daniel-segars-and-kelli-segars/low-impact-4-week-fat-loss-program-for-beginners/ebook/product-21250586.html"&gt;4-week program&lt;/a&gt; 
set up by the awesome folks at &lt;a href="http://www.fitnessblender.com/"&gt;Fitness Blender&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be doing a weekly update of my progress here and see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="fitness"></category></entry><entry><title>good habits: the root cause in turning your dreams into reality</title><link href="http://su.mattlebrun.com/good-habits.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-09-23T15:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>matt lebrun</name></author><id>tag:su.mattlebrun.com,2012-09-23:good-habits.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I attended a dream boarding workshop with Mickey last September 22. What I 
thought to be just a day of fulfilling &lt;em&gt;"boyfriend duties"&lt;/em&gt;, turned out 
quite amazing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a realization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you didn't know; dream boarding is when you put visual 
representation of your goals, desires, ambitions, dreams or what have you 
in a piece of card board &lt;em&gt;(best on an illustration board).&lt;/em&gt; The idea is 
that, these images becomes a mantra or a cue. Something that you can focus 
on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the workshop activities were timebound and the board we used is small 
(1/8 illustration board), we were forced to prioritize what to put on the 
board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This got me thinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the most important goals do I have in the next couple of years or 
the next few months even? Then I realized that what I really need is to 
improve myself further. And how do I do that? Form better habits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe much of what we wanted to achieve in life may just be a byproduct of 
having good habits. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>don't waste time, it's more scarce than you think!</title><link href="http://su.mattlebrun.com/dont-waste-time.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-07-26T18:30:00+08:00</updated><author><name>matt lebrun</name></author><id>tag:su.mattlebrun.com,2012-07-26:dont-waste-time.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you say "yes" to others, make sure you are not saying "no" to 
yourself.
- Paulo Coelho&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I've been reminded of my struggle for having ownership with my work. 
A puzzle that I've finally solved after reaching a crossroad in my career. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've realized that when you're just doing your job or joined a company for 
the money, you're not only short-changing yourself, you're also doing it to 
the organization. If you're like me, who always makes sure you got your end 
covered so as not to drag people down, you'll probably feel bad about doing 
this intentionally or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recalling my previous work experiences; Yes I was challenged, excited, 
learned and shared new things, met new people, and I grew my skills set. 
But I never felt I owned the things I've done nor the projects I've 
launched. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point it just felt mechanical &lt;em&gt;-- input given, output delivered.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No extra-mile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No flowery, feel good, &lt;em&gt;if-I-blew-this-I'll-feel-like-shit-the-next-day&lt;/em&gt; 
effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always ask the question, "To what end am I doing this?". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usual &lt;em&gt;(and wrong)&lt;/em&gt; answer: For the money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I never really identified with the organizations I've joined in the 
past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I didn't get the chance to work on things that aligned with my 
strong points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But whatever the reason is, once you've realized these things it's time to 
stay true to yourself and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change your attitude or leave the job if you have to &lt;em&gt;(or both)&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just be sure you're not just doing it for the money &lt;em&gt;-- or you just 
momentarily have to as part of a grander purpose.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do it for love and passion instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dear friend always reminds me that the money always comes after. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Again:&lt;/strong&gt; Don't waste time, it's more scarce than you think!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="thoughts"></category></entry></feed>
