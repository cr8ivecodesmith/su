I'm a curious guy. I look a the world with an eye of wonder. When I'm interested in something -- may
it be a game, a skill, a piece of technology, a practice, etc. -- I tend to learn as much as I can
about it. Use or learn it to the way it should be or bring it to its full potential. Sometimes I
even go a step further and use or apply it in unexpected ways.

This space is dedicated to those endeavors that I may always remember them.
