[Pound for Pound Boxer's Workout][1]

#### Workout Split

| Day | Training (Bodyparts)                    |
|:---:|:----------------------------------------|
| 1   | Boxing workouts                         |
| 2   | Weights (back, legs)                    |
| 3   | Boxing workouts                         |
| 4   | Weights (chest, arms)                   |
| 5   | Boxing workout                          |
| 6   | Rest/Optional run (work up to 5 miles)  |
| 7   | Rest                                    |

Note: Because of the volume of training you get during boxing workouts, Fortune
recommends avoiding regular weight training for shoulders. If this is a lagging
bodypart, incorporate no more than 6–8 sets of basic presses and raises on day 6.


#### Days 1, 3, 5 - Boxing Workout

| Plyometric push-up    | 6    to failure (2)   |
| Shoulder circuit      | 3    3 min. (3)       |
| Abs circuit           | 3    3 min. (4)       |

Rest no longer than one minute between sets. Between exercises, rest only as
long as it takes to get set up on the next activity.

1. If you have a partner or trainer, you can substitute mitt work for heavy bag
   work.
2. Choose three different versions of plyometric push–ups. Complete two sets of
   each, stopping the set once you begin to lose momentum.
3. Choose a light set of dumbbells (start with 2–5 pounds) and work on 30–second
   cycles within each three–minute set. A typical circuit with Fortune involves
   30 seconds at a time of straight punching, overhead punching, rear-delt raises,
   lateral raises, shoulder presses and a 30–second hold.
4. Choose three different exercises and perform each one for one minute. Rest one
   minute after each three–minute circuit.
